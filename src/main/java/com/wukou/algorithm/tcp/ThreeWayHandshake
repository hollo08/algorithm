1:The principle reason for the three-way handshake is to prevent old duplicate connection initiations from causing confusion

ack attacks:
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
or
1,Controls the maximum value of this queue
net.core.netdev_max_backlog
SYN_RCVD 状态连接的最大个数：
2,Controls the maximum number of  SYN_RCVD state connections
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog
3,When the processing capacity is overflown, The new SYN is directly returned to RST and the connecitons is discarded.
net.ipv4.tcp_abort_on_overflow


four-way wave
#define TCP_TIMEWAIT_LEN (60*HZ) /* how long to wait to destroy TIME-WAIT state, about 60 seconds  */
